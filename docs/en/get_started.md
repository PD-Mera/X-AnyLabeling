### 1.1 Prerequisites

#### 1.1.1 Miniconda

**Step 0.** Download and install Miniconda from the [official website](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

**Step 1.** Create a conda environment with Python 3.10 ~ 3.12 and activate it.

> [!NOTE]
> Other Python versions require compatibility verification on your own.

```bash
# CPU Environment [Windows/Linux/macOS]
conda create --name x-anylabeling-cpu python=3.10 -y
conda activate x-anylabeling-cpu

# CUDA 11.x Environment [Windows/Linux]
conda create --name x-anylabeling-cu11 python=3.11 -y
conda activate x-anylabeling-cu11

# CUDA 12.x Environment [Windows/Linux]
conda create --name x-anylabeling-cu12 python=3.12 -y
conda activate x-anylabeling-cu12
```

#### 1.1.2 Venv

In addition to Miniconda, you can also use Python's built-in `venv` module to create virtual environments. Here are the commands for creating and activating environments under different configurations:

```bash
# CPU [Windows/Linux/macOS]
python3.10 -m venv venv-cpu
source venv-cpu/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv-cpu\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# CUDA 12.x [Windows/Linux]
python3.12 -m venv venv-cu12
source venv-cu12/bin/activate  # Linux
# venv-cu12\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# CUDA 11.x [Windows/Linux]
python3.11 -m venv venv-cu11
source venv-cu11/bin/activate  # Linux
# venv-cu11\Scripts\activate    # Windows
```

> [!TIP]
> For faster dependency installation and a more modern Python package management experience, we strongly recommend using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as your package manager. uv provides significantly faster installation speeds and better dependency resolution capabilities.

#### 1.2.3 GUI Installer Package

> **Download Link**: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/releases)

Compared to running from source code, the GUI installer package provides a more convenient user experience. Users don't need to understand the underlying implementation and can use it directly after extraction. However, the GUI installer package also has some limitations:

- **Difficult Troubleshooting**: If crashes or errors occur, it may be difficult to quickly identify the specific cause, increasing the difficulty of troubleshooting.
- **Feature Lag**: The GUI version may lag behind the source code version in functionality, potentially leading to missing features and compatibility issues.
- **GPU Acceleration Limitations**: Given the diversity of hardware and operating system environments, current GPU inference acceleration services require users to compile from source code as needed.

Therefore, it is recommended to choose between running from source code and using the GUI installer package based on your specific needs and usage scenarios to optimize the user experience.

## 2. Usage
