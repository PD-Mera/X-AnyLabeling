# Oriented Bounding Boxes Object Detection Example

## Introduction

Oriented object detection surpasses standard object detection by adding angular precision to pinpoint objects in images.

## Usage

The calibration process for the rotated object detection task is as follows:

- Import the image file.
- Click the `rotations` button on the left menu bar or press the shortcut key `O` to quickly draw a rotated box.
- Select the corresponding rotated box object and adjust the rotation angle using the following shortcut keys:

| Shortcut Key | Description                |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| z            | Rotate counterclockwise by a large angle (default: 1.0째) |
| x            | Rotate counterclockwise by a small angle (default: 0.1째) |
| c            | Rotate clockwise by a small angle (default: 0.1째) |
| v            | Rotate clockwise by a large angle (default: 1.0째) |

To display the rotation degrees, you can click 'View' in the top menu bar, and check 'Show Degrees' to display the estimated rotation angle in real-time.

> [!NOTE]
> **Rotation Increment Customization (X-AnyLabeling v3.3.0+)**
> 
> You can customize the rotation increment angles by configuring the `.xanylabelingrc` file in your user directory. Add or modify the following settings under the `canvas` section:
> 
> ```yaml
> canvas:
>   rotation:
>     large_increment: 1.0  # degrees, corresponds to Z/V keys
>     small_increment: 0.1  # degrees, corresponds to X/C keys
> ```
> 
> The increment values are specified in degrees and can be adjusted to suit your annotation precision requirements.
